# Autocorrect Functionality

This project aims to build an autocorrect functionality for correcting spelling, grammar, and sentence structure errors, without training any new models. We will leverage existing libraries and tools to perform the corrections.

## Features
- **Spelling Correction**: Automatically corrects misspelled words.
- **Grammar Correction**: Fixes grammatical errors in sentences.
- **Sentence Structure Correction**: Improves the overall structure of sentences.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Identifies named entities and corrects references between pronouns and nouns.

## Steps to Build the Autocorrect Functionality

### Step 1: Text Preprocessing
1. **Tokenize** the input text into individual words.
2. **Remove punctuation** and special characters.
3. **Convert all text to lowercase** to standardize the input.

### Step 2: Spelling Correction
- Use the `PyEnchant` library, which provides spell-checking functionality.
- Create a dictionary of correctly spelled words.
- Check each word in the input text against the dictionary.
- If a word is misspelled, suggest corrections from the dictionary.

### Step 3: Grammar and Sentence Correction
- Use the `NLTK` library (Natural Language Toolkit), a popular Python library for NLP tasks.
- Perform **part-of-speech (POS) tagging** to identify the parts of speech in the sentence.
- Use NLTK’s **grammar correction** functionality to correct grammatical errors.
- Use NLTK’s **sentence parsing** functionality to correct sentence structure errors.

### Step 4: Contextual Analysis
- Use NLTK's **named entity recognition (NER)** functionality to identify named entities in the sentence.
- Use NLTK’s **coreference resolution** functionality to identify relationships between pronouns and the nouns they refer to, ensuring contextual correctness.

## Required Libraries
- `PyEnchant`: For spelling correction
- `NLTK`: For grammar correction, sentence parsing, and contextual analysis

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pyenchant nltk
